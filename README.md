## Snake Game

This code is a basic Snake game application. When you run it, a window titled "Snake" will appear with a black game field. You control a snake using the arrow keys on your keyboard. The objective is to guide the snake to eat red apples that randomly appear on the field. The snake moves continuously in the direction it's facing. Every 0.5 seconds, the game checks for your input and updates accordingly. If the snake's head touches an apple, it eats it and grows longer. The game ends if the snake hits the field boundaries or if its head collides with its own body. The window closes at that point. The snake's head is yellow, and the rest of its body is green. The apples are red.
