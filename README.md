# PySimpleGui

This is the code I created by following the PySimpleGui tutorial created by **Clear Code** on youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ8DGP9p2LY&t=1" target="_blank">here</a>

In this tutorial we created 10 diffrent apps using PySimpleGui in python each of these apps is housed in their own folder. as you can see there is an app.py file inside the root directory this file is PySimpleGui application that is used to launch the other applications.
